## Nifty Works 

We desire to make great chips in great ways. Here are three main topics we are 
focusing.

### Extreme Chips

There have been always strong demands on chips that do more jobs, communicate 
faster, and consume less power. 
However, it becomes much harder to improve the performance of chips due to 
the diminishing return of process scaling.
To keep improving the performance of chips in the end-of-Moore's-law era, we 
are working on implementing innovative circuit and system design techniques 
that push the performance of chips beyond the technology limit.

### Auto Chips

As the advanced CMOS technology nodes use new device structures (such as FinFET, 
FDSOI) and multiple patterning, it becomes much harder and expensive to 
design a chip in advanced technologies. In order to reduce the design cost, 
we are working on automatic chip generators that produce cool chips for various 
design targets and applications.

### Smart Chips

More and more intelligent functions are being integrated to chips to implement 
smart systems for data-driven applications, such as AI, autonomous vehicles, 
AR/VR, and cognitive/adaptive systems. We are working on producing chips that 
accelerate various smart functions in efficient ways.

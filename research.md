## Nifty Works 

We desire to make great chips in great ways. Here are three main topics we are 
focusing.

### Extreme Chips

While the demands on high performance chips are getting higher, improving the 
performance of chips becomes much harder than before due to the diminishing 
returns of process scaling.
Therefore, we are working on innovative circuit and system design techniques 
that push the performance of chips beyond the technology limit.

### Auto Chips

As the advanced CMOS technology nodes adopt sophisticated manufacturing 
techniques (such as FinFET and multiple patterning), it becomes much harder and 
expensive to build chips in advanced technologies. In order to reduce the 
chip design cost, we are working on automatic chip generators that produce 
complicated chips for various design targets and applications.

### Smart Chips

More and more intelligent functions are being integrated to chips for smart 
applications, such as AI, autonomous vehicles, AR/VR. We are working on 
implementing smart chips that accelerate cool functions.
